Robotics is a field that has long captured the human imagination. Today, we are on the cusp of a robotics revolution, with advancements in AI, materials science, and engineering converging to create more capable and autonomous robots than ever before.

## Robotics in the Real World

Robots are no longer confined to factory floors. They are now being used in a wide range of applications:

- **Logistics:** Autonomous mobile robots are a common sight in warehouses, where they help to automate the process of sorting and transporting goods.
- **Healthcare:** Surgical robots are assisting surgeons with complex procedures, leading to better patient outcomes.
- **Exploration:** Robots are being sent to explore environments that are too dangerous for humans, such as the deep sea and other planets.

Here's an interactive element to demonstrate the power of simple components:
